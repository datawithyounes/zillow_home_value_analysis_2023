# Zillow Home Value Data: An SQL Exploration

<strong>In this project, I used SQL to explore Zillow's home value data. I was interested in learning more about how home values have changed over time, and what factors might be driving these changes.

I used SQL to answer these questions :

- [Questions](https://github.com/httpyns/zillow_home_value_analysis_2023/blob/main/questionnaire/README.md)
  
I also used SQL to create visualizations of the data. These visualizations helped me to better understand the data and to communicate my findings to others.
